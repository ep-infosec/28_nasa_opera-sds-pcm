# This file defines the outputs that are expected to be produced by the
# different PGEs within the PCM.
# 
# Outputs - This area defines the different file name patterns for the
# expected outputs:
# 
# Primary - Refers to the primary output product, which is usually the *.nc
# files. Any product found here will be converted to a HySDS style
# dataset.
#
# Secondary - Refers to the other output product types like *.log, *.qa, etc.
# Any product found here will be copied into the dataset directories produced
# from the Primary section.
# 
# Optional - Refers to other outputs that may/may not be produced from the
# PGE. If a product cannot be found with the regex patterns given here, PCM
# will still continue with processing.
# 
# Missing_Metadata - Defines a list of metadata to fill in the .met.json.
